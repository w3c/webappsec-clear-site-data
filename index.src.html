  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Web applications store data locally on a user's computer in order to provide
  functionality while the user is offline, and to increase performance when the
  user is online. These local caches have significant advantages for both users
  and developers, but present risks as well.

  A user's data is both sensitive and valuable; web developers ought to take
  reasonable steps to protect it. One such step would be to encrypt data before
  storing it. Another would be to remove data from the user's machine when it is
  no longer necessary (for example, when the user signs out of the application,
  or deletes their account).

  Site authors can remove data from a number of storage mechanisms via
  JavaScript, but others are difficult to deal with reliably. Consider cookies,
  for instance, which can be partially cleared via JavaScript access to
  `document.cookie`. `HttpOnly` cookies, however, can only
  be removed via a number of `Set-Cookie` headers in an HTTP
  response. This, of course, requires exhaustive knowledge of all the cookies
  set for a host, which can be complicated to ascertain. Cache is still harder;
  no imperative interface to a browser's network cache exists, period.

  This document defines a new mechanism to deal with removing data from these
  and other types of local storage, giving web developers the ability to clear
  out a user's local cache of data via the <a http-header>Clear-Site-Data</a> HTTP response
  header.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <h4 id="example-signout">Signing Out</h4>

  <div class="example">
    A user signs out of Super Secret Social Network via a CSRF-protected POST to
    `https://supersecretsocialnetwork.example.com/logout`, and the
    site author wishes to ensure that locally stored data is removed as a
    result.

    They can do so by sending the following HTTP header in the response:

    <pre>
      <a http-header>Clear-Site-Data</a>: "<a grammar>cache</a>", "<a grammar>cookies</a>", "<a grammar>storage</a>", "<a grammar>executionContexts</a>"
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="example-targeted">Targeted Clearing</h4>

  <div class="example">
    A user signs out of Megacorp Inc.'s site via a CSRF-protected POST to
    `https://megacorp.example.com/logout`. Megacorp has a large
    number of services available as subdomains, so many that it's not entirely
    clear which of them would be safe to clear as a response to a logout action.
    One option would be to simply clear everything, and deal with the fallout.
    Megacorp's CEO, however, once lost hours and hours of progress in "Irate
    Ibexes" due to inadvertent site-data clearing, and so refuses to allow such
    a sweeping impact to the site's users.

    The developers know, however, that the "Minus" application is certainly safe
    to clear out. They can target this specific subdomain by including a request
    to that subdomain as part of the logout landing page (ideally as a
    CORS-enabled, CSRF-protected POST):

    <pre>
      fetch("https://minus.megacorp.example.com/clear-site-data",
            {
                method: "POST",
                mode: "cors",
                headers: new Headers({
                    "CSRF": "[<em>insert sekrit token here</em>]"
                })
            });
    </pre>

    That endpoint would return proper CORS headers in response to that request's
    preflight, and would return the following header for the actual request:

    <pre>
      <a http-header>Clear-Site-Data</a>: "<a grammar>cache</a>", "<a grammar>cookies</a>", "<a grammar>storage</a>", "<a grammar>executionContexts</a>"
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="example-keepcookies">Keep Critical Cookies</h4>

  <div class="example">
    A user opts-out of interest-based advertising via a CSRF-protected POST to
    `https://ads-are-awesome.example.com/optout`. The site author
    wishes to remove DOM-accessible data which might contain tracking
    information, but needs to ensure that the opt-out cookie which the user has
    just received isn't wiped along with it.

    They can do so by sending the following HTTP header in the response, which
    includes all the types except for "<a grammar>cookies</a>":

    <pre>
      <a http-header>Clear-Site-Data</a>: "<a grammar>cache</a>", "<a grammar>storage</a>", "<a grammar>executionContexts</a>"
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="example-killswitch">Kill Switch</h4>

  <div class="example">
    Super Secret Social Network's developers learn that the site was vulnerable
    to cross-site scripting attacks which allowed malicious parties to inject
    arbitrary code into its origin. They fixed the site, and added a strong
    Content Security Policy [[CSP]] to mitigate the risk going forward, but
    they can't be entirely sure that clients are really back to a trustworthy
    state. Perhaps the attackers found a clever persistence mechanism?

    They can reduce the risk of a persistent client-side XSS by sending the
    following HTTP header in a response to wipe out local sources of data:

    <pre>
      <a http-header>Clear-Site-Data</a>: "<a grammar>cache</a>", "<a grammar>cookies</a>", "<a grammar>storage</a>", "<a grammar>executionContexts</a>"
    </pre>

    Note: Installing a Service Worker guarantees that a request will go out to
    a server every ~24 hours. That update ping would be a wonderful time to send
    a header like this one in case of catastrophe. [[SERVICE-WORKERS]]
  </div>

  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

  Generally, the goal is to allow web developers more control over the data
  stored locally by a user agent for their origins. In particular, developers
  should be able to reliably ensure the following:

  1.  Data stored in an origin's client-side storage mechanisms like [[INDEXEDDB]],
      WebSQL, Filesystem, {{localStorage}}, and {{sessionStorage}} is cleared.
  2.  Cookies for an origin's host are removed [[!RFC6265]].
  3.  Web Workers (dedicated and shared) running for an origin are terminated.
  4.  Service Workers registered for an origin are terminated and deregistered.
  5.  Resources from an origin are removed from the user agent's local cache.
  6.  The [=Accept-CH cache=] for an origin is purged.
  7.  None of the above can be bypassed by a maliciously active document that
      retains interesting data in memory, and rewrites it if it's cleared.

  This document uses ABNF grammar to specify syntax, as defined in [[!RFC5234]] and updated in
  [[!RFC7405]], along with the `#rule` extension defined in
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-7">Section 7</a> of [[!RFC7230]], and the
  `quoted-string` rule defined in

<section>
  <h2 id="clearing">Clearing Site Data</h2>

  Developers may instruct a user agent to clear various types of relevant data
  by delivering a `Clear-Site-Data` HTTP response header in response to a request.

  <h3 id="header">
    The `Clear-Site-Data` HTTP Response Header Field
  </h3>

  The <dfn http-header>`Clear-Site-Data`</dfn> HTTP response header field sends a signal to the
  user agent that it ought to remove all data of a certain set of types. The header is
  represented by the following grammar:

  <pre class="abnf" link-type="grammar" dfn-type="grammar">
    Clear-Site-Data = 1#( <a>quoted-string</a> )
    ; <a>#rule</a> is defined in Section 7 of RFC 7230.
  </pre>

  [[#fetch-integration]] and [[#parsing]] describe how the
  <a http-header>Clear-Site-Data</a> header is processed.

  This document defines an initial set of known data types which can be cleared using this
  mechanism. See their descriptions below. Future versions of the header can support
  additional datatypes, which MUST comply with the <a grammar>quoted-string</a> grammar. User agents
  MUST ignore unknown types when parsing the header.

  :   "<dfn grammar>`cache`</dfn>"
  ::  The "`cache`" type indicates that the server wishes to remove locally
      cached data associated with the <a>origin</a> of a particular
      <a>response</a>'s [=response/url=]. This includes the <a>network
      cache</a>, of course, but will also remove data from various other caches
      which a user agent implements (prerendered pages, script caches, shader
      caches, [=Accept-CH cache=], etc.).

      Implementation details are in [[#clear-cache]].

      <div class="example">
        When delivered with a response from `https://example.com/clear`,
        the following header will cause caches associated with the origin
        `https://example.com`: to be cleared:

        <pre>
          <a http-header>Clear-Site-Data</a>: "<a grammar>cache</a>"
        </pre>
      </div>

      Note: Caches are typically not organized by origin, but rather by URL and
      timestamp. This means that in practice, clearing cache by origin might
      have to be implemented using a linear scan. For large caches, this makes
      it a prohibitively expensive operation.

  :   "<dfn grammar>`cookies`</dfn>"
  ::  The "`cookies`" type indicates that the server wishes to remove cookies
      associated with the <a>origin</a> of a particular <a>response</a>'s
      [=response/url=]. Along with cookies, HTTP authentication credentials
      [[!RFC7235]], and origin-bound tokens such as those defined by Channel
      ID [[!CHANNELID]] and Token Binding [[!TOKBIND]] are also cleared.

      Implementation details are in [[#clear-cookies]].

      <div class="example">
        When delivered with a response from `https://example.com/clear`,
        the following header will cause cookies associated with the origin
        `https://example.com` to be cleared, as well as cookies on any origin in
        the same registered domain (e.g. `https://www.example.com/` and
        `https://more.subdomains.example.com/`).

        <pre>
          <a http-header>Clear-Site-Data</a>: "<a grammar>cookies</a>"
        </pre>
      </div>

      Note: Clearing cookies should also clear the [=Accept-CH cache=] for
      <a>origin</a>. This is because the cache is also cleared if the user
      manually clears cookies.

  :   "<dfn grammar>`storage`</dfn>"
  ::  The "`storage`" type indicates that the server wishes to remove
      locally stored data associated with the <a>origin</a> of a
      particular <a>response</a>'s [=response/url=]. This includes storage
      mechanisms such as ({{localStorage}}, {{sessionStorage}}, [[INDEXEDDB]],
      [[WEBDATABASE]], etc), as well as tangentially related mechanism such as
      <a>service worker registrations</a>.

      Implementation details are in [[#clear-dom]].

      <div class="example">
        When delivered with a response from `https://example.com/clear`,
        the following header will cause DOM-accessible storage for the origin 
        `https://example.com` to be cleared:

        <pre>
          <a http-header>Clear-Site-Data</a>: "<a grammar>storage</a>"
        </pre>
      </div>

  :   "<dfn grammar>`executionContexts`</dfn>"
  ::  The "`executionContexts`" type indicates that the server wishes to neuter
      and reload execution contexts currently rendering the <a>origin</a> of a
      particular <a>response</a>'s [=response/url=].

      <div class="example">
        When delivered with a response from `https://example.com/clear`,
        the following header will cause execution contexts displaying the origin 
        `https://example.com` to be neutered and reloaded:

        <pre>
          <a http-header>Clear-Site-Data</a>: "<a grammar>executionContexts</a>"
        </pre>
      </div>

  :   "<dfn grammar>`clientHints`</dfn>"
  ::  The "`clientHints`" type indicates that the server wishes clear the [=Accept-CH cache=]
      for the <a>origin</a> of a particular <a>response</a>'s [=response/url=].

      <div class="example">
        When delivered with a response from `https://example.com/clear`,
        the following header will cause the [=Accept-CH cache=] for origin 
        `https://example.com` to be cleared:

        <pre>
          <a http-header>Clear-Site-Data</a>: "<a grammar>clientHints</a>"
        </pre>
      </div>

      Note: The [=Accept-CH cache=] is also cleared for the <a grammar>cache</a> and
      <a grammar>cookies</a> options, so it should be used only when neither of the
      other options (or <a grammar>*</a>) are applied.

  :   "<dfn grammar>`*`</dfn>"
  ::  The "`*`" (wildcard) pseudotype indicates that the server has the same
      effect as specifying all types.

      <div class="example">
        When delivered with a response from `https://example.com/clear`,
        the following header will cause all cookies, caches, and DOM-accessible
        storage associated with the origin `https://example.com` to be cleared,
        as well as execution contexts for the same origin to be neutered and
        reloaded:

        <pre>
          <a http-header>Clear-Site-Data</a>: "<a grammar>*</a>"
        </pre>
      </div>

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          Note: The wildcard is forward-compatible in the sense that if more
          datatypes are added in future versions of this header, they will also
          be covered by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          DO use the wildcard if the intention is to perform a broad cleanup,
          i.e. clear all data associated with an origin that the header knows
          about.
        </p>
        <p>
          DO NOT use the wildcard as a shorthand for the four types listed
          above, as this meaning might change.
        </p>
      </div>

  Note: The syntax defined here is compatible with future extensions to this document which might
  add more granular filtering mechanisms to the types we've defined. For example, it's likely that
  "<a grammar>`cookies`</a>" will need to grow a mechanism to prevent deletion of specific cookie
  values. Wrapping all of the type names in double-quotes means that we can easily shift from
  simple splitting-strings-on-commas processing to something more complicated (like processing the
  header value as JSON) without losing backwards compatibility.

  <h3 id="fetch-integration">Fetch Integration</h3>

  ISSUE: Monkey patching! Talk with Anne.

  If the <a http-header>`Clear-Site-Data`</a> header is present in an HTTP <a>response</a>
  received from the network, then data MUST be cleared before rendering the
  response to the user. That is, after step #14 in the current
  <a>HTTP-network fetch</a> algorithm, execute the following step:

  15.  If <var ignore>credentials flag</var> is set, and |response|'s
       [=response/header list=] contains a header named <a http-header>`Clear-Site-Data`</a>, then
       execute [[#clear-response]] on |response|.

  Note: This happens <em>after</em> `Set-Cookie` headers are
  processed. If we clear cookies, we clear all of them. This is intentional, as
  removing only certain cookies might leave an application in an indeterminate
  and vulnerable state. Removing specific cookies is best done via expiration 
  using the `Set-Cookie` header.

  Note: If we clear the [=Accept-CH cache=] via the `Clear-Site-Data` header then any
  `Accept-CH` and `Critical-CH` headers in the same request must be ignored.

  Note: While the fetch `credentials flag` is intended to restrict the
  modification of cookies, <a http-header>`Clear-Site-Data`</a> applies the same restriction
  to all types for the sake of consistency.

  <h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h2>

  <h3 id="parsing" algorithm>Parsing</h3>

  Given a [=response=], the user agent can <dfn abstract-op local-lt="parse response">parse
  |response|'s `Clear-Site-Data` header</dfn>, returning a list of types, as follows:

  <ol class="algorithm">
    1.  Let |types| be an empty list.

    2.  Let |header| be the result of [=extracting header list values=] given `Clear-Site-Data` and
        |response|'s [=response/header list=].

    3.  If |header| is `null` or failure, return an empty list.

    4.  For each |type| in |header|, execute the first matching statement, if any, switching on
        |type|:

        :   \``"cache"`\`
        ::  Append "<a grammar>cache</a>" and "<a grammar>clientHints</a>" to |types|.
        :   \``"cookies"`\`
        ::  Append "<a grammar>cookies</a>" and "<a grammar>clientHints</a>" to |types|.
        :   \``"storage"`\`
        ::  Append "<a grammar>storage</a>" to |types|.
        :   \``"executionContexts"`\`
        ::  Append "<a grammar>executionContexts</a>" to |types|.
        :   \``"clientHints"`\`
        ::  Append "<a grammar>clientHints</a>" to |types|.
        :   \``"*"`\`
        ::  Append "<a grammar>cache</a>", "<a grammar>cookies</a>", "<a grammar>storage</a>",
            "<a grammar>clientHints</a>", and "<a grammar>executionContexts</a>" to |types|.

    5.  Return |types|.
  </ol>

  Note: All of the existing values can be handled with the simple switch above. If and when more
  complex type definitions are created, the parser will likely shift over to JSON entirely.

  <h3 id="clear-response" algorithm>
    Clear data for |response|
  </h3>

  Given a [=response=] (|response|), the user agent can <dfn abstract-op>clear site data for
  |response|</dfn> as follows:

  <ol class="algorithm">
    1.  If |response|'s [=response/url=] is not an <a><i lang="la">a priori</i> authenticated
        URL</a>, then [=iteration/break=].

    2.  Let |types| be the result of <a lt="parse response" abstract-op>parsing |response|'s
        `Clear-Site-Data` header</a>.

    3.  Let |origin| be |response|'s [=response/url=]'s [=url/origin=].

    4.  Let |browsing contexts| be the result of <a lt="prepare" abstract-op>preparing to clear
        data</a> for |origin| and |types|.

    5.  For each |type| in |types|:
   
        1.  Execute the first matching statement, if any, switching on |type|:

            :   "<a grammar>`cache`</a>"
            ::  <a lt="clear cache" abstract-op>Clear cache for |origin|</a>.
            :   "<a grammar>`cookies`</a>"
            ::  <a lt="clear cookies" abstract-op>Clear cookies for |origin|</a>.
            :   "<a grammar>`storage`</a>"
            ::  <a lt="clear storage" abstract-op>Clear DOM-accessible storage for |origin|</a>.
            :   "<a grammar>`clientHints`</a>"
            ::  [=list/Empty=] [=Accept-CH cache=][|origin|].

    6.  If |types| contains "<a grammar>executionContexts</a>", then
        <a lt="reload" abstract-op>Reload |browsing contexts|</a>.
  </ol>

  Note: User agents are are encouraged to give web developers some mechanism by which the clearing
  operation can be debugged. This might take the form of a console message or timeline entry
  indicating success.

  <h4 id="prepare" algorithm>
    Prepare to clear |origin|'s data
  </h4>

  Given an [=origin=] (|origin|) and a list of types (|types|), the user agent can
  <dfn local-lt="prepare" abstract-op>prepare to clear |origin|'s data</dfn> by executing
  the following steps. The algorithm returns a list of [=browsing contexts=] which have been
  sandboxed in order to prevent them from recreating cleared data from in-memory JavaScript
  variables.

  <ol class="algorithm">
    1.  Let |sandboxed| be an empty list.

    2.  If |types| does not [=list/contain=] "<a grammar>`executionContexts`</a>", return
        |sandboxed|.

    3.  For each |context| in the user agent's set of [=browsing contexts=]:

        1.  Let |document| be |context|'s [=active document=].

        2.  If |document|'s [=relevant settings object=]'s [=environment settings object/origin=]
            is not |origin|, [=iteration/continue=].

            ISSUE: This is the simplest thing, but it's probably reaching a little too far into the

    Clear cache for |origin|

  <ol class="algorithm">
    1.  Let |host| be |origin|'s [=origin/host=].

    4.  If a user agent implements caches beyond a pure <a>network cache</a>, it MUST remove all

        ISSUE: We're dealing with the network cache here, as defined in [[!RFC7234]], but that's not
        nearly everything a user agent caches. How hand-wavey with the vendor-specific section can
        we be? For instance, Chrome clears out prerendered pages, script caches, WebGL shader
        caches, WebRTC bits and pieces, address bar suggestion caches, various networking bits that
        aren't representations (HSTS/HPKP, SCDH, etc.). Perhaps [[STORAGE]] will make this clearer?

  <h4 id="clear-cookies">

  Given an <a>origin</a> (|origin|), the user agent can
  <dfn local-lt="clear cookies" abstract-op>clear cookies for |origin|</dfn> as follows:
  
  Note: We remove all the cookies for an entire <a>registered domain</a>, as cookies ignore the
  same-origin policy, and there's a distinct risk that we'd leave applications in an ill-defined
  state if we only cleared cookies for a particular subdomain. Consider `accounts.google.com` vs
  `mail.google.com`, for instance, both of which have cookies that signal a user's signed-in status.

  Note: This algorithm assumes that the user agent has implemented a <a>cookie store</a> (as
  discussed in Section 5.3 of [[!RFC6265]]), which offers the ability to retrieve a list of cookies
  by host, and to remove individual cookies.

  <ol class="algorithm">
    1.  Let |registered| be the <a>registered domain</a> of |origin|'s [=origin/host=].

    2.  Let |cookie list| be the set of cookies from the <a>cookie

        |registered|.

    3.  For each |cookie| in |cookie list|:
    
        1.  Remove |cookie| from the <a>cookie store</a>.

    4.  If the user agent supports other forms of cookie-like storage, these MUST also be cleared
        for [=origins=] whose [=origin/host=]'s <a>registered domain</a> is |registered|.

        Note: For example, if the user agent supports Flash, its local stored objects will be
        cleared via <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/NPAPI:ClearSiteData">NPP_ClearSiteData</a>.

  <h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="incomplete">Incomplete Clearing</h3>

  It is possible that an application could be put into an indeterminate state
  by clearing only one type of storage. We mitigate that to some extent by
  clearing all storage options as a block, and by requiring that the header be
  delivered over a secure connection.

  <h3 id="service-workers">Service workers</h3>

  It is imperative that the Clear-Site-Data header is only respected on
  responses fetched over network, and not those served by a service worker.

  This is because service workers can return arbitrary responses for resource
  requests in their scope, including third-party requests. Thus, supporting
  Clear-Site-Data would give them the ability to clear data for any origin.

  Note that if a request is sent to a service worker, not handled by it, then
  restarted with a [=request/service-workers mode=] of "`none`" and sent to the network, the
  corresponding response is a network response and can be handled. The previous attempt at obtaining
  the response from a service worker is irrelevant.

  Note also that a service worker update is a network response, and is therefore
  not affected by this restriction. This is important in order to support the
  use case in [[#example-killswitch]].

  <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="user-vs-author">Web developers control the timing.</h3>

  If triggered at appropriate times, <a http-header>`Clear-Site-Data`</a> can
  increase a user's privacy and security by clearing sensitive data from their
  user agent. However, note that the web developer (and <em>not</em> the user)
  is in control of when the clearing event is triggered. Even assuming a
  non-malicious site author, users can't rely on data being cleared at any
  particular point, nor are users in control of what data types are cleared.

  If a user wishes to ensure that site data is indeed cleared at some specific
  point, they ought to rely on the data-clearing functionality offered by their
  user agent.

  At a bare minimum, user agents OUGHT TO (in the [[RFC6919]] sense of the
  words) offer the same functionality to users that they offer to web
  developers. Ideally, they will offer significantly more than we can offer at
  a platform level (clearing browsing history, for example).

  <h3 id="remnants">Remnants of data on disk.</h3>

  While <a http-header>`Clear-Site-Data`</a> triggers a clearing event in a
  user's agent, it is difficult to make promises about the state of a user's
  disk after a clearing event takes place. In particular, note that it is up
  to the user agent to ensure that all traces of a site's date is actually
  removed from disk, which can be a herculean task (consider virtual memory,
  as a good example of a larger issue).

  In short, most user agents implement data clearing as "best effort", but
  can't promise an exhaustive wipe.

  If a user wishes to ensure that site data does not remain on disk, the best
  way to do so is to use a browsing mode that promises not to intentionally
  write data to disk (Chrome's "Incognito", Internet Explorer's "InPrivate",
  etc). These modes will do a better job of keeping data off disk, but are
  still subject to a number of limitations at the edges.
