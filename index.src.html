<section>
  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Web applications store data locally on a user's computer in order to provide
  functionality while the user is offline, and to increase performance when the
  user is online. These local caches have significant advantages for both users
  and developers, but present risks as well.

  A user's data is both sensitive and valuable; web developers ought to take
  reasonable steps to protect it. One such step would be to encrypt data before
  storing it. Another would be to remove data from the user's machine when it is
  no longer necessary (for example, when the user signs out of the application,
  or deletes their account).

  Site authors can remove data from a number of storage mechanisms via
  JavaScript, but others are difficult to deal with reliably. Consider cookies,
  for instance, which can be partially cleared via JavaScript access to
  `document.cookie`. `HttpOnly` cookies, however, can only
  be removed via a number of `Set-Cookie` headers in an HTTP
  response. This, of course, requires exhaustive knowledge of all the cookies
  set for a host, which can be complicated to ascertain. Cache is still harder;
  no imperative interface to a browser's network cache exists, period.

  This document defines a new mechanism to deal with removing data from these
  and other types of local storage, giving web developers the ability to clear
  out a user's local cache of data via the <a>Clear-Site-Data</a> HTTP response
  header.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <h4 id="example-signout">Signing Out</h4>

  <div class="example">
    A user signs out of Super Secret Social Network via a CSRF-protected POST to
    `https://supersecretsocialnetwork.example.com/logout`, and the
    site author wishes to ensure that locally stored data is removed as a
    result.

    They can do so by sending the following HTTP header in the response:

    <pre>
      <a>Clear-Site-Data</a>: { "<a>types</a>": [ "<a>cache</a>", "<a>cookies</a>", "<a>storage</a>", "<a>executionContexts</a>" ] }
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="example-targeted">Targeted Clearing</h4>

  <div class="example">
    A user signs out of Megacorp Inc.'s site via a CSRF-protected POST to
    `https://megacorp.example.com/logout`. Megacorp has a large
    number of services available as subdomains, so many that it's not entirely
    clear which of them would be safe to clear as a response to a logout action.
    One option would be to simply clear everything, and deal with the fallout.
    Megacorp's CEO, however, once lost hours and hours of progress in "Irate
    Ibexes" due to inadvertent site-data clearing, and so refuses to allow such
    a sweeping impact to the site's users.

    The developers know, however, that the "Minus" application is certainly safe
    to clear out. They can target this specific subdomain by including a request
    to that subdomain as part of the logout landing page (ideally as a
    CORS-enabled, CSRF-protected POST):

    <pre>
      fetch("https://minus.megacorp.example.com/clear-site-data",
            {
                method: "POST",
                mode: "cors",
                headers: new Headers({
                    "CSRF": "[<em>insert sekrit token here</em>]"
                })
            });
    </pre>

    That endpoint would return proper CORS headers in response to that request's
    preflight, and would return the following header for the actual request:

    <pre>
      <a>Clear-Site-Data</a>: { "<a>types</a>": [ "<a>cache</a>", "<a>cookies</a>", "<a>storage</a>", "<a>executionContexts</a>" ] }
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="example-keepcookies">Keep Critical Cookies</h4>

  <div class="example">
    A user opts-out of interest-based advertising via a CSRF-protected POST to
    `https://ads-are-awesome.example.com/optout`. The site author
    wishes to remove DOM-accessible data which might contain tracking
    information, but needs to ensure that the opt-out cookie which the user has
    just received isn't wiped along with it.

    They can do so by sending the following HTTP header in the response, which
    includes all the types except for "<a>cookies</a>":

    <pre>
      <a>Clear-Site-Data</a>: { "<a>types</a>": [ "<a>cache</a>", "<a>storage</a>", "<a>executionContexts</a>" ] }
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="example-killswitch">Kill Switch</h4>

  <div class="example">
    Super Secret Social Network's developers learn that the site was vulnerable
    to cross-site scripting attacks which allowed malicious parties to inject
    arbitrary code into its origin. They fixed the site, and added a strong
    Content Security Policy [[CSP2]] to mitigate the risk going forward, but
    they can't be entirely sure that clients are really back to a trustworthy
    state. Perhaps the attackers found a clever persistence mechanism?

    They can reduce the risk of a persistent client-side XSS by sending the
    following HTTP header in a response to wipe out local sources of data:

    <pre>
      <a>Clear-Site-Data</a>: { "<a>types</a>": [ "<a>cache</a>", "<a>cookies</a>", "<a>storage</a>", "<a>executionContexts</a>" ] }
    </pre>

    Note: Installing a Service Worker guarantees that a request will go out to
    a server every ~24 hours. That update ping would be a wonderful time to send
    a header like this one in case of catastrophe. [[SERVICE-WORKERS]]
  </div>

  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

  Generally, the goal is to allow web developers more control over the data
  stored locally by a user agent for their origins. In particular, developers
  should be able to reliably ensure the following:

  1.  Data stored in an origin's client-side storage mechanisms like [[INDEXEDDB]],
      WebSQL, Filesystem, {{localStorage}}, and {{sessionStorage}} is cleared.
  2.  Cookies for an origin's host are removed [[!RFC6265]].
  3.  Web Workers (dedicated and shared) running for an origin are terminated.
  4.  Service Workers registered for an origin are terminated and deregistered.
  5.  Resources from an origin are removed from the user agent's local cache.
  7.  All of the above can be propagated to the HTTP version of an HTTPS origin.
  8.  None of the above can be bypassed by a maliciously active document that
      retains interesting data in memory, and rewrites it if it's cleared.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="clearing">Clearing Site Data</h2>

  Developers may instruct a user agent to clear various types of relevant data
  in two ways: an HTTP response header, and a JavaScript API:

  <h3 id="header">
    The `Clear-Site-Data` HTTP Response Header Field
  </h3>

  The <dfn>`Clear-Site-Data`</dfn> HTTP response header field
  sends a signal to the user agent that it ought to remove all data
  of a certain set of types. The header is represented by the following ABNF
  [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre class="abnf" link-type="grammar" dfn-type="grammar">
    Report-To = <a>json-field-value</a>
                ; See Section 2 of [[HTTP-JFV]], and Section 2 of [[RFC7159]]
  </pre>

  The header's value is interpreted as an array of JSON objects, as described in
  Section 4 of [[HTTP-JFV]].

  Each object in the array represents a clearing action that the user agent MUST
  undertake, and will be parsed as defined in [[#parsing]].

  The following subsections defined the initial set of known members in each
  JSON object the header's value defines. Future versions of this document may
  define additional such members, and user agents MUST ignore unknown members
  when parsing the header.

  <h4 id="types-member">
    The `types` member
  </h4>

  The <dfn>`types`</dfn> member is an array of keywords designating the kinds
  of data that the server wishes the user agent to remove. The member's value
  MUST be an array, and that array MUST contain only strings; any other types
  will result in a parse error.

  The following are the initial set of known types which may be specified in
  the member's array value. Future versions of this document may define
  additional types, and user agents MUST ignore unknown types when parsing the
  header:

  :   "<dfn>`cache`</dfn>"
  ::  The "`cache`" type indicates that the server wishes to remove locally
      cached data associated with the <a>origin</a> of a particular
      <a>response</a>'s {{Response/url}}. This includes the <a>network
      cache</a>, of course, but will also remove data from various other caches
      which a user agent implements (prerendered pages, script caches, shader
      caches, etc.).

      Implementation details are in [[#clear-cache]].

      <div class="example">
        When delivered with a response from `https://example.com/clear`,
        the following header will cause caches associated with the origin
        `https://example.com`: to be cleared:

        <pre>
          <a>Clear-Site-Data</a>: { "<a>types</a>": [ "<a>cache</a>" ] }
        </pre>
      </div>

  :   "<dfn>`cookies`</dfn>"
  ::  The "`cookies`" type indicates that the server wishes to remove cookies
      associated with the <a>origin</a> of a particular <a>response</a>'s
      {{Response/url}}. Along with cookies, HTTP authentication credentials
      [[!RFC7235]], and origin-bound tokens such as those defined by Channel
      ID [[!CHANNELID]] and Token Binding [[!TOKBIND]] are also cleared.

      Implementation details are in [[#clear-cookies]].

      <div class="example">
        When delivered with a response from `https://example.com/clear`,
        the following header will cause cookies associated with the origin
        `https://example.com` to be cleared:

        <pre>
          <a>Clear-Site-Data</a>: { "<a>types</a>": [ "<a>cookies</a>" ] }
        </pre>
      </div>

  :   "<dfn>`storage`</dfn>"
  ::  The "`storage`" type indicates that the server wishes to remove
      locally stored data associated with the <a>origin</a> of a
      particular <a>response</a>'s {{Response/url}}. This includes storage
      mechansims such as ({{localStorage}}, {{sessionStorage}}, [[INDEXEDDB]],
      [[WEBDATABASE]], etc), as well as tangentially related mechainsm such as
      <a>service worker registrations</a>.

      Implementation details are in [[#clear-dom]].

      <div class="example">
        When delivered with a response from `https://example.com/clear`,
        the following header will cause DOM-accessible storage for the origin 
        `https://example.com` to be cleared:

        <pre>
          <a>Clear-Site-Data</a>: { "<a>types</a>": [ "<a>storage</a>" ] }
        </pre>
      </div>

  :   "<dfn>`executionContexts`</dfn>"
  ::  The "`executionContexts`" type indicates that the server wishes to neuter
      and reload execution contexts currently rendering the <a>origin</a> of a
      particular <a>response</a>'s {{Response/url}}.

      Implementation details are in [[#neuter-contexts]].

      <div class="example">
        When delivered with a response from `https://example.com/clear`,
        the following header will cause execution contexts displaying the origin 
        `https://example.com` to be neutered and reloaded:

        <pre>
          <a>Clear-Site-Data</a>: { "<a>types</a>": [ "<a>executionContexts</a>" ] }
        </pre>
      </div>

  <h3 id="dom-api">JavaScript API</h3>

  ISSUE: This might live more cleanly in [[STORAGE]].

  <div class="example">
    Megacorp, Inc. wants to remove data in response to a user's activity on
    their site. They can execute the following JavaScript to clear all the
    relevant data for a user:

    <pre>
      navigator.storage.<a method>clear()</a>;
    </pre>

    If they only wished to clear the otherwise inaccessible cache for the
    current origin:

    <pre>
      navigator.storage.<a method>clear</a>({
        <a dict-member>types</a>: [ "cache" ],
      });
    </pre>
  </div>

  <pre class="idl">
    enum StorageClearType {
      "cache",
      "cookies",
      "storage",
      "executionContexts"
    };

    dictionary StorageClearOptions {
      required sequence&lt;StorageClearType&gt; types;
    };

    partial interface StorageManager {
      Promise&lt;void&gt; clear(StorageClearOptions options);
    };
  </pre>
  <dl dfn-for="StorageManager">
    <dt><dfn method lt="clear(options)">clear(options)</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      Clears data based on the values in the |options| argument.
      Returns a Promise that resolves when clearing is complete. If no
      {{StorageClearOptions/types}} are specified, all data types will be
      cleared.

      <pre class="argumentdef" for="StorageManager/clear(options)">
        options: The data to clear.
      </pre>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h3 id="fetch-integration">Fetch Integration</h3>

  ISSUE: Monkey patching! Talk with Anne.

  If the <a>`Clear-Site-Data`</a> header is present in an HTTP <a>response</a>
  received from the network, then data MUST be cleared before rendering the
  response to the user. That is, after step #14 in the current
  <a>HTTP-network fetch</a> algorithm, execute the following step:

  15.  If <var ignore>credentials flag</var> is set, and |response|'s
       <a>header list</a> contains a header named <a>`Clear-Site-Data`</a>, then
       execute [[#clear-response]] on |response|.

  Note: This happens <em>after</em> `Set-Cookie` headers are
  processed. If we clear cookies, we clear all of them. This is intentional, as
  removing only certain cookies might leave an application in an indeterminate
  and vulnerable state. Removing specific cookies is best done via expiration 
  using the `Set-Cookie` header.

  Note: While the fetch `credentials flag` is intended to restrict the
  modification of cookies, <a>`Clear-Site-Data`</a> applies the same restriction
  to all <a>types</a> for the sake of consistency.
<section>

<section>
  <h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h2>

  <h3 id="parsing">Parsing</h3>

  <h4 id="get-types">
    Which data types ought to be removed for |response|?
  </h4>

  1.  If |response| does not contain a <a>`Clear-Site-Data`</a> header, return
      an empty list.

  2.  Let |types| be an empty list.

  3.  Let |list| be the result of executing the algorithm defined in Section 4
      of [[!HTTP-JFV]] on the value of |response|'s <a>`Clear-Site-Data`</a>
      header. If that algorithm results in an error, return an empty list.

  4.  For each |item| in |list|:

      1.  If |item| does not have a <a>`types`</a> member, skip to the next
          |item|.

      2.  For each |type| in |item|'s <a>`types`</a> member's value:

          1.  If |type| is <a>`cache`</a>, <a>`cookies`</a>, <a>`storage`</a>,
              or <a>`executionContexts`</a>, append |type| to |types|.

              Otherwise, skip to the next |type|.

  5.  Return |types|.

  <h3 id="clear-response">
    Clear data for |response|
  </h3>

  Given a <a>response</a> (|response|), this algorithm parses the
  <a>`Clear-Site-Data`</a> header to determine what needs to be

  1.  If |response|'s {{URL}} is <a><i lang="la">a priori</i>
      insecure</a>, skip the remaining steps of this algorithm.

      ISSUE: Some have suggested that this might not be a restriction we want
      (see
      <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2015Jun/0032.html">Martin
      Thomson's public-webappsec post on the topic</a>, for example).

  2.  Let |types| be the result of [[#get-types]] executed on
      |response|.

  3.  Execute [[#clear-internal]] on |types|, |response|'s
      {{Response/url}}'s <a>origin</a>.

  Note: Especially given the cross-context implications, user agents are
  are encouraged to give web developers some mechanism by which the clearing
  operation can be debugged. This might take the form of a console message or
  timeline entry indicating success.

    Clear data for |options|
  </h3>

  Given a {{StorageClearOptions}} (|options|), this algorithm
  determines what needs to be cleared, returns a Promise, and executes the
  request asynchronously.

  1.  If the <a>incumbent settings object</a> is not a <a>secure context</a>,
      return a `Promise` rejected with
      `NotSupportedError`.

  2.  Let |promise| be a newly created `Promise` object.

  3.  Return |promise|, and execute the remaining steps asynchronously.

  4.  Let |types| be an empty list.

  5.  If |options|' {{StorageClearOptions/types}} is an empty sequence:

      1. Append `cache`, `cookies`,
         `storage`, and `executionContexts` to
         |types|.

  6.  Otherwise, for each {{StorageClearType}} |type| in
      |options|' {{StorageClearOptions/types}} property:

      1. Append |type| to |types|.

  7.  Execute [[#clear-internal]] on |types| and the <a>incumbent

  Given an <a>origin</a> (|origin|) this algorithm walks through the
  set of <a>browsing contexts</a> which the user agent knows about, and
  sandboxes each in order to prevent them from recreating cleared data (from
  in-memory JavaScript variables, for instance). Once data is cleared, the
  affected browsing contexts will be hard-reloaded, as defined in
  [[#reload-contexts]]:

  1.  For each |context| in the user agent's set of <a>browsing
      contexts</a>:

      1.  Let |document| be |context|'s <a>active
          document</a>.

      2.  While |document| is <a>an `iframe srcdoc`
          document</a>, let |document| be the <a>active document</a>
          of |document|'s <a>browsing context container</a>.

      3.  If |context|'s <a>origin</a> is |origin|:

          1.  <a>Parse a sandboxing directive</a> using the empty string as
              the input, and |document|'s <a>active
              sandboxing flag set</a> as the output.

  <h4 id="reload-contexts">
    Reload browsing contexts matching |origin|
  </h4>

  Given an <a>origin</a> (|origin|), this algorithm walks through the
  set of <a>browsing contexts</a> which the user agent knows about and reloads
  each of them:

  1.  For each |context| in the user agent's set of <a>browsing
      contexts</a>:

      1.  Let |document| be |context|'s <a>active
          document</a>.

      2.  While |document| is <a>an `iframe srcdoc`
          document</a>, let |document| be the <a>active document</a>
          of |document|'s <a>browsing context container</a>.

      3.  If |context|'s <a>origin</a> is |origin|:

          1.  Navigate |context| to |document|'s {{URL}} with
              <a>replacement enabled</a> and <a>exceptions enabled</a>. The
              <a>source browsing context</a> is |context|. This is a

  <h4 id="clear-cache">
    Clear cache for |origin|
  </h4>

  Given an <a>origin</a> (|origin|), this algorithm removes data from
  the user agent's local caches that matches the origin.

  1.  Let |host| be |origin|'s {{URL/host}},
      <a>canonicalized</a> as per Section 5.1.2 of [[!RFC6265]].

  3.  Let |cache list| be the set of entries from the <a>network
      cache</a> whose `target URI` {{URL/host}} is identical to
      |host| when <a>canonicalized</a> as per Section 5.1.2 of
      [[!RFC6265]].

  4.  For each |entry| in |cache list|:
 
      1.  Remove |entry| from the <a>network cache</a>.

  5.  If a user agent implements caches beyond a pure <a>network cache</a>, it
      MUST remove all entries from those caches which match |origin|.

      ISSUE: We're dealing with the network cache here, as defined in
      [[!RFC7234]], but that's not nearly everything a user agent caches. How
      hand-wavey with the vendor-specific section can we be? For instance,
      Chrome clears out prerendered pages, script caches, WebGL shader caches,
      WebRTC bits and pieces, address bar suggestion caches, various networking
      bits that aren't representations (HSTS/HPKP, SCDH, etc.). Perhaps
      [[STORAGE]] will make this clearer?

  <h4 id="clear-cookies">
    Clear cookies for |origin|

  Given an <a>origin</a> (|origin|), this algorithm removes cookies
  from the user agent's <a>cookie store</a> whose `domain` attribute
  <a>domain-matches</a> |origin|'s <a>registered domain</a>.
  
  Note: We remove all the cookies for an entire <a>registered domain</a>, as
  cookies ignore the same-origin policy, and there's a distinct risk that we'd
  leave applications in an ill-defined state if we only cleared cookies for a
  particular subdomain. Consider `accounts.google.com` vs `mail.google.com`,
  for instance, both of which have cookies that signal a user's signed-in
  status.

  Note: This algorithm assumes that the user agent has implemented a <a>cookie
  store</a> (as discussed in Section 5.3 of [[!RFC6265]]), which offers the
  ability to retrieve a list of cookies by host, and to remove individual
  cookies.

  1.  Let |host| be |origin|'s {{URL/host}},
      <a>canonicalized</a> as per Section 5.1.2 of [[!RFC6265]].

  2.  Let |registered| be the <a>registered domain</a> of |host|.

  3.  Let |cookie list| be the set of cookies from the <a>cookie
      store</a> whose `domain` attribute is a <a>domain-match</a> with
      |registered|.

  4.  For each |cookie| in |cookie list|:
  
      1.  Remove |cookie| from the <a>cookie store</a>.

  5.  Clear related origin-bound Channel IDs [[!CHANNELID]] and
      tokens [[!TOKBIND]].

  6.  Clear related HTTP authentication credentials [[!RFC7235]].

  ISSUE(w3c/webappsec-clear-site-data#2): The process of clearing both bound
  tokens/IDs and HTTP authentication is super hand-wavey.

  <h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="incomplete">Incomplete Clearing</h3>

  It is possible that an application could be put into an indeterminate state
  by clearing only one type of storage. We mitigate that to some extent by
  clearing all storage options as a block, and by requiring that the header be
  delivered over a secure connection.

  <h3 id="service-workers">Service workers</h3>

  It is imperative that the Clear-Site-Data header is only respected on
  responses fetched over network, and not those served by a service worker.

  This is because service workers can return arbitrary responses for resource
  requests in their scope, including third-party requests. Thus, supporting
  Clear-Site-Data would give them the ability to clear data for any origin.

  Note that if a request is sent to a service worker, not handled by it, then
  restarted with a <a>skip-service-worker flag</a> and sent to the network, the
  corresponding response is a network response and can be handled. The previous
  attempt at obtaining the response from a service worker is irrelevant.

  Note also that a service worker update is a network response, and is therefore
  not affected by this restriction. This is important in order to support the
  use case in [[#example-killswitch]].

  <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="user-vs-author">Web developers control the timing.</h3>

  If triggered at appropriate times, <a>`Clear-Site-Data`</a> can
  increase a user's privacy and security by clearing sensitive data from their
  user agent. However, note that the web developer (and <em>not</em> the user)
  is in control of when the clearing event is triggered. Even assuming a
  non-malicious site author, users can't rely on data being cleared at any
  particular point, nor are users in control of what data types are cleared.

  If a user wishes to ensure that site data is indeed cleared at some specific
  point, they ought to rely on the data-clearing functionality offered by their
  user agent.

  At a bare minimum, user agents OUGHT TO (in the [[RFC6919]] sense of the
  words) offer the same functionality to users that they offer to web
  developers. Ideally, they will offer significantly more than we can offer at
  a platform level (clearing browsing history, for example).

  <h3 id="remnants">Remnants of data on disk.</h3>

  While <a>`Clear-Site-Data`</a> triggers a clearing event in a
  user's agent, it is difficult to make promises about the state of a user's
  disk after a clearing event takes place. In particular, note that it is up
  to the user agent to ensure that all traces of a site's date is actually
  removed from disk, which can be a herculean task (consider virtual memory,
  as a good example of a larger issue).

  In short, most user agents implement data clearing as "best effort", but
  can't promise an exhaustive wipe.

  If a user wishes to ensure that site data does not remain on disk, the best
  way to do so is to use a browsing mode that promises not to intentionally
  write data to disk (Chrome's "Incognito", Internet Explorer's "InPrivate",
  etc). These modes will do a better job of keeping data off disk, but are
  still subject to a number of limitations at the edges.
